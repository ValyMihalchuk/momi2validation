# Determining the effectiveness of momi2 for inferring demographic history in GADMA

The demographic history of populations is the history of the development of populations with parameters such as the number of populations, the time of their separation, the rate of migration and selection. Based on genetic data, these parameters can be reconstructed using various statistical methods.
This project determines the accuracy of demographic history output using the momi2 engine added to GADMA.


Aim:
-Determining the effectiveness of momi2 for inferring demographic history in GADMA

Objectives:
=Select Demographic History
-Simulate genetic data for the selected history
-Restore parameters using GADMA with momi2 engine
-Compare the obtained parameters with the original ones
